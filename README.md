# Python Data Analysis

## What is it? 
This is a project I completed while studying computer science at Duke University. Both part 1 and part 2 read in large raw data files on the earthquakes around the world that happened for 30 days around February/March 2016. The data was obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) EarthQuakes Hazards Program. The programs in both parts contain functions which extract and analyze the data in order to answer certain questions about it, and display those answers to the user. The programs would work for any earthquake data presented in the same format as the files used in this project.
